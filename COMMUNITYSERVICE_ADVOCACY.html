    <h2>COMMUNITY SERVIVE AND ADVOCACY</h2>
    <p class="para1">Community service, at its core, refers to voluntary work intended to benefit the community or individuals within the community. It embodies the spirit of giving back, nurturing a culture where individuals come together, pooling their skills, resources, and time to address various societal needs.As a student in tcgc i believes that such advocacy is more than just a gesture; instead, it’s a lifeline for those in need. We see the value of playing the role of the bridge that connects them with those who can help.
